#SpaceShooter

#### SpaceShooter is a mini game built on [ActionScript 3.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript) using [Flash Builder](http://www.adobe.com/products/flash-builder.html). 
#### ![Starling Framework](http://gamua.com/img/starling/title-logo.png) SpaceShooter relies on the [Starling Framework](http://gamua.com/starling/), a open source engine for Flash, built on top the of [Stage3D](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/stage3d.html) and takes advantage of it - all content is rendered directly by the GPU.
#### The most difficult part of the creating process was the collision detection and the animation process. 
#### Many hours of work resulted in this way: ![SpaceShooter](http://oi39.tinypic.com/euixl2.jpg)
#### There are six types of enemies - four of them are some kind of intergalactic alien spaceships, and two of them are flying saucers. Aliens pass from the top to the bottom, while saucers from right to left. Saucers are harder to kill because their speed is bigger and the width of the screen is less than the height. But, they give much more score points than the spaceships.
#### The game has three types of powerups, which result in giving you some additional lives (you lose one when a spaceship passes the bottom of the screen, i.e. you didn't kill it) and score points.
#### When killing a spaceship of rank 4 (the same as spaceships in the start screen of the game), you get an additional life. But be careful, the bigger is your score the harder is to play! :)
#### Probably the most beautiful thing regarding the fact that this game was built on the [Starling Framework](http://gamua.com/starling/), is the fact that it can be easily ported to a mobile platform like [iOS](http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_(Apple)) or [Android](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)).
#### It's an early beta and it was done for fun and entertainment, don't expect it to be super-cool and stuff.
#### Have fun and thanks for visiting! ;)
